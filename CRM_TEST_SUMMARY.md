ðŸ“ž New Booking Request: {...}
ðŸ“¤ Sending to CRM: https://dashboard-alpha-one-85.vercel.app/api/webhooks/leads
âœ… CRM Response: {...}
âœ… Successfully sent to CRM

3. Test webhook with cURL again
4. Check CRM for any validation errors

### Check Integration Status:
```bash
# Test the booking API
curl -X POST https://airlinesmap.com/api/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerName":"Test User",
    "customerEmail":"test@example.com",
    "customerPhone":"+1-555-1234",
    "flightDetails":{
      "from":"JFK",
      "to":"LHR",
